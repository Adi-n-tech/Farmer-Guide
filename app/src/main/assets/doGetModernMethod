      "description": "With the increase  in world population and urbanization, the  area  under  cultivation  was  decreased  in  last  few years. There is a crucial need to solve  the double-edged problem  of  shrinking cultivated  land  and  produce  food for  an  ever-increasing  population.  So  the  ground-breaking  concept  of  vertical  farming  came  forward  to increase  the  crop yield  using  less land.  The farm  uses soil  less  farming  technology  such  as  hydroponics  and aeroponics  to  produce  more  yields  faster  through-out the  season  by  knowing the  nutritional  and  temperature requirement  of  crop.   These  techniques  not  only increase  the  harvest  by  3-5 times  but  also  produce the food using less water, pesticides and fertilizers usage.",

To  meet  the  huge  food grain  requirement  of  480 million  tonnes  (Mt)  by  the year  2050,  advancement  in  space technology  (courtesy to  Indian  Space  Research  Organization  (ISRO)  and  IT revolutionized  new scopes  for  farm  sectors.  Positioning system  works  by  the  help of  different constellations  of satellites.  The  technologies  implemented  were  GPS, GIS, variable rate application of input, crop sensors, etc",

      "description": "Modern  agriculture  has  taken  advantage  of  the advancement  in a  large  number of  molecular  breeding and a  biotechnological  tool,  crop  productivity has  been increased  in  the  recent  past.  The  hybrid  varieties resistance  to  numerous  biotic  abiotic  stresses  was developed  in  several  important  crops  using  marker-assisted  selection  (MAS),  QTL  mapping  and  gene pyramiding technologies. These techniques help in earl y release  of  varieties  and  more  accurate  methods  as compared to conventional breeding techniques",
